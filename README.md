## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing medical insurance data to understand the factors that influence healthcare premium costs. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, the goal is to uncover patterns related to age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and other demographic factors, and to build models that can predict insurance charges. The insights derived from this analysis can help insurance companies make informed business decisions and optimize premium pricing strategies.

## Key objectives:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical insurance data to uncover meaningful patterns.
- Understand how demographic and lifestyle factors affect insurance premium charges
- Analyze the impact of smoking status on healthcare costs across different age groups
- Examine relationships between age, BMI, number of children, region, and insurance charges
- Identify the most influential features contributing to higher medical insurance premiums
- Build and evaluate predictive models to estimate insurance costs
- Support data-driven decision-making for insurance pricing and risk assessment
- Compare performance of CNN and transfer learning models.
- Use data augmentation to improve model accuracy and generalization.
